# Simple Scraper

This project is a simple scraper that can currently:
- work with html documents returned by some websites.
- You can pass the scraper the information from which html tag you need, and specify an additional attribute that is present in this tag (if any).
- As a result, the content contained on the site will be returned, the content will be displayed in the terminal, and saved in the result.txt file.
